- print("String to Print on Console") and print "String to Print"   // both gives same output 
 
- In the 'opt' directory of linux machine u r supposed to put all ur optional programs such as pycharm editor could be put in
   this directory 

- MAC(Media Access Control) address is permanent, physical and unique address which is assigned to network interfaces by 
  manufacturer , IP address is used in the internet to identify computers and communicate between devices on the internet,
  while the MAC address is used within the network to indentify devices and transfer data between devices.
  So each pack of data which is send within the network contains the source MAC and the destination MAC.
  
- Changing MAC address provides us ->
  - Anonymity
  - Impersonate other devices
  - Bypass filters
  - or connect to network which only specific devices and specific MAC addresses r allowed to connect
  
- use cmd -> ifconfig // to list interfaces on the current computer, interface here means a network card
- The interfaces created in virtual machines r virtual interfaces bcz we set this machine to use NAT network
  'lo' is the virtual interface created by linux, 'wlan0' is the external USB wireless adapter, 'ether' in the 'eth0' here
  represents the MAC address
  
- ifconfig eth0 down // to disable the interface
- ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55    // To change the MAC address to address -> 00:11:22:33:44:55
- ifconfig eth0 up    // to enable the interface

- always check the main python documentation for the module such as subprocess to know more functionalities of the module

- Variable Scopes ->
      
      my_name = 'ryu'       # Global Scope Variable
      
      def print_name():
        my_age = 8          # local scope variable
        print('Name is',my_name,my_age)   # here my_name and my_age both r accessible
        
      print_name()
      print('Name is',my_name,my_age) # here my_name is accessible but my_age is not accessible
      
      - Overwriting Variable
      
      my_name = 'ryu'       # Global Scope Variable
      
      def print_name():
        my_name = 'abc'          # overwriting global scope variable
        print('Name is',my_name)   # here o/p is abc
        
      print_name()
      print('Name is',my_name) # here o/p is ryu
      
      - to override variables globally
      
      my_name = 'ryu'       # Global Scope Variable
      
      def print_name():
        global my_name        # use global if u wants the variable to be override globally
        my_name = 'abc'          
        print('Name is',my_name)   # here o/p is abc
        
      print_name()
      print('Name is',my_name) # here o/p is abc

- Python Prgm for MAC changer ->

# subprocess module contains a number of functions, these functions allow us to execute any system commands not just
# only linux cmds, cmds depend on the OS which executes the script
# Syntax -> import subprocess
#           subprocess.call("COMMAND",Shell=True)

# subprocess.call(args, *, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, shell=False) // this function allows us to run system
# cmds but runs the cmd in the foreground not in the background, doesn't run it in different thread and wait for the cmd
# to finish executing before moving to the next line
# Foreground contains the application the user is working on

import subprocess

subprocess.call("ifconfig eth0 down", shell=True)
subprocess.call("ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:55:44:33:22:11", shell=True)
subprocess.call("ifconfig eth0 up", shell=True)
subprocess.call("ifconfig", shell=True)         # to list all the interfaces
