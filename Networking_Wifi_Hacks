- MAC(Media Access Control) address is permanent, physical and unique address which is assigned to network interfaces by 
  manufacturer , IP address is used in the internet to identify computers and communicate between devices on the internet,
  while the MAC address is used within the network to identify devices and transfer data between devices.
  So each pack of data which is send within the network contains the source MAC and the destination MAC.
  
- Changing MAC address provides us ->
  - Anonymity
  - Impersonate other devices
  - Bypass filters
  - or connect to network which only specific devices and specific MAC addresses r allowed to connect
  
- use cmd -> ifconfig // to list interfaces on the current computer, interface here means a network card
- The interfaces created in virtual machines r virtual interfaces bcz we set this machine to use NAT network
  'lo' is the virtual interface created by linux, 'wlan0' is the external USB wireless adapter, 'ether' in the 'eth0' here
represents the MAC address
- For 'lo' and 'wlan0' u will notice u don't have an IP address and this is bcz none of these interfaces r connected to a network
- If u look into the right most corner of the kali and click a dropdown icon u will see the their is an option saying that the
'Wifi Not Connected' and that's why the 'wlan0' currently does not have an IP address

- ifconfig wlan0 down // to disable the interface
- ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55    // To change the MAC address to address -> 00:11:22:33:44:55
- ifconfig wlan0 up // to enable the interface

- Whether u r watching a video or doing chat etc all the data is send in packets, In the network devices ensure that these packets go
th right direction using the MAC address So each packet has a source MAC and destination MAC, Now if we want to send the packet to the
router from the machine then we need to enter the MAC address of the Router
- We can capture the data packets which r in the air even if they do not contain the destination MAC address, for this we need to change
the mode of operation of our wireless interface so that it operates in Monitor mode

cmd -> iwconfig   // to see wireless interfaces only and to check the monitor mode
Here u will see the inteface data for wlan0 only and the mode in it would be Managed this means that this is the default mode of all
wireless devices and this device will only capture packets that has the destination MAC as the MAC address of this device
cmd -> ifconfig wlan0 down // before changing the mode
cmd -> airmon-ng check kill // to kill the process which could interfer when using the interface in monitor mode, this is not
                            // mandatory cmd, this cmd will kill the network manager and u will lose the internet connection and this is
                            // ok as we do not require the internet connection to run any of the attaks reuired in monitor mode

cmd -> airmon-ng start wlan0 // this will start monitor mode on the interface wlan0

- After enabling the monitor mode on our wireless interface we r able to capture all the wifi packets sent within our range even
if the packet is not directed to our computer even if we r not connected to the target network and even without knowing the key
or the password of the target network so we just only need a program that will capture these packets for us, prgm we r going to use
is 'airodump-ng' it's part of the 'aircrack-ng' suit and it's a packet sniffer so it's basically a program designed to capture packets
while u r in monitor mode
So it will allow us to see all the wireless networks around us and show us detailed information about ->
MAC address
Channel
Encryption
Clients connected to this network etc

cmd -> airodump-ng wlan0 //start the monitor mode and discover wireless networks
press ctrl+c // to quit

Now in monitor mode ->
- ESSID // it shows the name of the wireless networks
- BSSID // it shows the MAC address
- PWR // it shows the signal strength, higher the number better the signal their is
- Beacons // these r frames sent by the network in order to broadcast its existence, So every network even if its hidden sent these
          // types of frames, So it basically tells all the devices around it that I exist
- #Data // this the no. of data packets
- CH // this is the channel
- MB // this is the maximum speed supported by the network
- ENC // this is the encryption used by the network, if it is 'OPEN' then it means their is no password protection even on the network
- CIPHER // it is the cipher used in the network
- AUTH // this is the autentication used on the network

Wifi band of a network defines what frequency it can use to broadcast the signal, this means it also define the frequency that the
clients or the computer need to be able to support and use in order to be able to connect to this network, two main frequncies used
in wifi networks r 2.4 and 5 ghz previously we were only sniffing on 2.4 ghz frequency and that's why u will notice that the wireless
card of ur system shows more wirless networks discovered then ur wireless adapter
In some places in world such as in ireland if the network is broadcasting over the 5ghz then the service provider will add 5g as the
postfix in the name or 'ssid' of the wireless network

cmd -> airodump-ng --band a wlan0 // this will switch and start sniffing on the 5 ghz frequency networks
cmd -> airodump-ng --band abg wlan0 // this will sniff on both 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies at the same time, the only problem is it
                                    // is slow as the sniffing on two bands make the lot channels that has to hop on
cmd -> airodump-ng --bssid target_network_bssid --channel channel_no --write file_name wlan0 // here we r telling to sniff and gather
 // more data on particular network and writing that gathered data in a file and after fireing the cmd it will show only one network
 // and their will be a 2nd section also which will show u the clients connected to that network and their MAC addresses
 // Here in 2nd section we can see the following parameters also such as
 // - Rate // it is the speed
 // - Lost // this is the amount of data lost
 // - Frames // these the packets which we have captured
 // - Probe // it shows the devices which r not connected but trying to connect with the network
 // press ctrl + c // to quit
 
 cmd -> ls // to list the files which contains the captured data of the network, u will see 4 files with the same name but different
 // extensions with some post fix no. also added to it ex test-01.cap but our file name was only 'test'
 // the file with extension 'cap' is the file that contains the data which we captured and it should contain the chat msgs, passwords
 // etc anything which the connected devices to our target network did on the internet but all the data which is sent between the router
 // and the connected devices is encrypted
 
 cmd -> wireshark // to start the wireshark prgm which helps to analyse the data and then go to the File and open the file with the
 // extension 'cap' and u will see that the data is encrypted except the device manufacture which was connected to the network so this
 // way u kind of guess what computers r their and what OS they use
