- MAC(Media Access Control) address is permanent, physical and unique address which is assigned to network interfaces by 
  manufacturer , IP address is used in the internet to identify computers and communicate between devices on the internet,
  while the MAC address is used within the network to identify devices and transfer data between devices.
  So each pack of data which is send within the network contains the source MAC and the destination MAC.
  
- Changing MAC address provides us ->
  - Anonymity
  - Impersonate other devices
  - Bypass filters
  - or connect to network which only specific devices and specific MAC addresses r allowed to connect
  
- use cmd -> ifconfig // to list interfaces on the current computer, interface here means a network card
- The interfaces created in virtual machines r virtual interfaces bcz we set this machine to use NAT network
  'lo' is the virtual interface created by linux, 'wlan0' is the external USB wireless adapter, 'ether' in the 'eth0' here
represents the MAC address
- For 'lo' and 'wlan0' u will notice u don't have an IP address and this is bcz none of these interfaces r connected to a network
- If u look into the right most corner of the kali and click a dropdown icon u will see the their is an option saying that the
'Wifi Not Connected' and that's why the 'wlan0' currently does not have an IP address

- ifconfig wlan0 down // to disable the interface
- ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55    // To change the MAC address to address -> 00:11:22:33:44:55
- ifconfig wlan0 up // to enable the interface

- Whether u r watching a video or doing chat etc all the data is send in packets, In the network devices ensure that these packets go
th right direction using the MAC address So each packet has a source MAC and destination MAC, Now if we want to send the packet to the
router from the machine then we need to enter the MAC address of the Router
- We can capture the data packets which r in the air even if they do not contain the destination MAC address, for this we need to change
the mode of operation of our wireless interface so that it operates in Monitor mode

cmd -> iwconfig   // to see wireless interfaces only
Here u will see the inteface data for wlan0 only and the mode in it would be Managed this means that this is the default mode of all
wireless devices and this device will only capture packets that has the destination MAC as the MAC address of this device
cmd -> ifconfig wlan0 down // before changing the mode
cmd -> airmon-ng check kill // to kill the process which could interfer when using the interface in monitor mode, this is not
                            // mandatory cmd, this cmd will kill the network manager and u will lose the internet connection and this is
                            // ok as we do not require the internet connection to run any of the attaks reuired in monitor mode
- Try using one of these cmds to start monitor mode
cmd -> iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor // this will change the mode to monitor mode
cmd -> airmon-ng start wlan0 // this will start monitor mode on the interface wlan0
